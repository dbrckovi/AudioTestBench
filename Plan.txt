A bunch of different input jacks and pins connected together.
All go to a DPDT input bypass switch which enables or disables the input buffer.
Signal from all inputs (buffered or not) goes to a two Banana SEND jacks towards circuit.

Output from circuit goes to two Banana RETURN jacks.
Return jacks go to DPDT output switch which enables or disables output buffer.
Output from buffer goes to a bunch of different output jacks.

Can't decide whether to make dual or single supply buffers, or both.
